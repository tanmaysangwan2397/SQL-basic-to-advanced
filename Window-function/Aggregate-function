Assume that you are given the table below containing information on viewership by device type (where the four types are laptop, desktop, tablet, and phone). Define “mobile” as the sum of tablet and phone viewership numbers. Define “PC” as the sum of laptop and desktop viewership numbers. Write a query to compare the viewership on PC versus mobile devices.

| Column_name   | 		 Type	    															|
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| user_id       | integer      																|
| device_type   | string('laptop','desktop','tablet','phone') |
| view_time     | timestamp																		|


Output the total viewership for laptop and mobile devices in the format of "PC_views" and "mobile_views".
